========================================================

I am guessing that at least some of the libraries in the output of

pkg-config opencv --libs

are archive libraries. It is incorrect to put archive libraries before sources that need them (test_1.cpp in this case): the order of sources and libraries on the link line matters.

Try

g++ -o test_1 test_1.cpp `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs`
